# FUTURE_ML_01
This project predicts future sales using historical retail data and machine learning. Time-based features are created and a regression model is trained to forecast demand. Visualizations present trends and future predictions clearly, helping businesses plan inventory, staffing, and financial decisions through data-driven insights.
# Sales Forecasting using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project builds a sales forecasting system using historical retail data to predict future demand. It demonstrates how machine learning can support real business decisions such as inventory planning, staffing, and revenue management. The model analyzes past sales patterns and generates future predictions with clear visualizations.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Time-based feature engineering  
- Regression-based forecasting model  
- Model evaluation using error metrics  
- Visualization of sales trends and predictions  
- Future 30-day sales forecast  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

## Dataset
Superstore retail sales dataset containing order dates and sales values used for demand forecasting and trend analysis.

## Working Process
The dataset is cleaned and transformed into time-based sales data.  
A machine learning regression model is trained on historical sales to learn trends.  
The model predicts future sales and visualizes both past and forecasted demand.

## Business Value
This project shows how forecasting helps businesses:
- Plan inventory and stock levels  
- Manage staffing requirements  
- Avoid losses due to overstocking  
- Make data-driven business decisions  

## Output
- Actual vs predicted sales visualization  
- Future sales forecast graph  
- Model performance evaluation
